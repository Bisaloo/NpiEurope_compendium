# Subfig A

Of the 13 different NPIs (26 if you differenciate "Partial" and "Complete") implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic across the 32 European countries that reported data to the ECDC, bans on mass gatherings and school closures have been the most widely used, implemented by more than 90% of countries. These NPIs were fully implemented for a median time of three to five months.

# Subfig B

Across all the public health responses analysed, stay at home orders, bans on mass gatherings and school/university closures were typically implemented together.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.asp=1, fig.cap='Correlation between implementation of each pair of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as part of public health responses. A positive correlation (green circles) reflects that a pair of NPIs were commonly implemented together.'}
