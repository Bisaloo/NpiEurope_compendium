# Subfig A

Of the 13 different NPIs (26 if you differenciate "Partial" and "Complete") implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic across the 32 European countries that reported data to the ECDC, bans on mass gatherings and school closures have been the most widely used, implemented by more than 90% of countries. These NPIs were fully implemented for a median time of three to five months.

# Subfig B

Across all the public health responses analysed, stay  at home  orders, bans  on mass gatherings andschool/university closures were typically implemented together.
